# Keyboard to Piano Note Mapping

# Piano Keyboard Structure with Sound Mapping

Below is a visual representation of a piano octave, showing how each key (white and black) is mapped to a sound file (note name):


```
  W   E       T   Y   U
  |   |       |   |   |
A   S   D   F   G   H   J   K
C4  D4  E4  F4  G4  A4  B4  C5

Black keys (W, E, T, Y, U) are positioned between the white keys as follows:
	W: between A (C4) and S (D4)
	E: between S (D4) and D (E4)
	T: between F (F4) and G (G4)
	Y: between G (G4) and H (A4)
	U: between H (A4) and J (B4)
```
